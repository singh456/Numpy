1 Create a tuple called data with two values, (1, 2) and (3, 4)
data = ((1, 2), (3, 4))
print(data)

2 Create the list [4, 3, 2, 1] and assign it to variable numbers.
numbers = [4, 3, 2, 1]
print(numbers)
var1, var2, var3 = [numbers[i] for i in (1, 3, 4)]
 
# printing result
print ("The variables are : " +  str(var1) +
                           " " + str(var2) +
                            " " + str(var3))

3 Create a copy of the number list using [:]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers_copy = numbers[:]
print(numbers_copy)

4 #Sort the numbers list in numerical order

numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)

5 #Create a tuple "cardinal_numbers" with "first", "second" and "third"
cardinal_numbers = ("first", "second", "third")
print(cardinal_numbers)

6 #Display the second object in the tuple

cardinal_numbers = ("first", "second", "third")
second_object = cardinal_numbers[1]
print(second_object)

7 #Unpack the tuple into three strings and display them
position1, position2, position3 = cardinal_numbers
print(position1)
print(position2)
print(position3)

8 #Create a tuple containing the letters of your name from a string
name = "kuldeep"
name_tuple = tuple(char for char in name)
print(name_tuple)

9 #Check whether or not x is in my_name
my_name = "Kuldeep"
x_present = "x" in my_name
print(x_present)

10 #Check whether or not s is in my_name
my_name = "Kuldeep Singh"
S_present = "S" in my_name
print(S_present)
